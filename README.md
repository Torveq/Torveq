## Hola

 I'm currently studying computer science at the U of M and currently working on making a game in python but I've worked on other stuff like made some python scripts for utility like an automatic email sender,
 a past paper search engine for A-level students, and attempted to fiddle with developing add ons for the graphic calculator the CG50 from Casio as you could probably tell by my forked repos.
